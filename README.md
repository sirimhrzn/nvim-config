# Editor Config

This is my config I use Neovim as text-editor with Alacritty for terminal and Zellij for terminal multiplexing for programming. I prefer neovim over any other IDE because of the flexibility with shortcuts and ability to turn ideas into code very quickly without needing to move my hands away from keyboard which ultimately boosts productivity.

## Tools

- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) [ 0.8 >= ]
- [Alacritty](https://alacritty.org/)
- [Zellij](https://zellij.dev/) 
- [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads)

## Config installation

This neovim config contains [OneDarkPro.nvim](https://github.com/olimorris/onedarkpro.nvim) for theme and [Clippy](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-clippy) has been configured for [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/)
